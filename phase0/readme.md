To run our program, you can run the Login.java class that will 
prompt instructions on how to create an account, login, and exit the 
program. 

The Login.java class will only allow you to create and account and
login, but we plan to make extensions to allow admin users to promote,
delete, or ban an account in phase 1 using our AdminManager controller.

All the instructions on how to create an account and log in will be
displayed in the IntelliJ command line below.
